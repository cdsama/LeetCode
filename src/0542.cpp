542. 01 Matrix
Medium

Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

Example 1: 
Input:

0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0

Output:

0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0

Example 2: 
Input:

0 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 1

Output:

0 0 0
0 1 0
1 2 1

Note:

The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.
