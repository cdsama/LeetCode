968. Binary Tree Cameras
Hard

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 
Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Example 1:

Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

Example 2:

Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
Every node has value 0.
