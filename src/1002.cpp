/*
1002. Find Common Characters
Easy

Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.
You may return the answer in any order.
 

Example 1:

Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]

Example 2:

Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]

 
Note:

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100
A[i][j] is a lowercase letter
