/*
30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
Hard

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
Example 1:

Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.

Example 2:

Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
