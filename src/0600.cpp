/*
600. Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones
Hard

Given a positive integer n, find the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.
Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 5
Explanation: 
Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule. 

Note:
1 <= n <= 109
