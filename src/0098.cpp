98. Validate Binary Search Tree
Medium

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:

Input:
    2
   / \
  1   3
Output: true

Example 2:

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6
Output: false
Explanation: The input is: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]. The root node's value
             is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
