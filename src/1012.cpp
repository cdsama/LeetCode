/*
1012. Numbers With Repeated Digits
Hard

Given a positive integer N, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have at least 1 repeated digit.
 

Example 1:

Input: 20
Output: 1
Explanation: The only positive number (<= 20) with at least 1 repeated digit is 11.

Example 2:

Input: 100
Output: 10
Explanation: The positive numbers (<= 100) with atleast 1 repeated digit are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, and 100.
